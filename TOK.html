      <p>When I went to go visit my cousins, it happened to be one of the younger one's birthday.<br>
	So I decided to make her a poster based on a TV show she really likes called <i>Gravity Falls</i>.<br>
	The first thing I did was draw up different sketches for ideas I had. When I finally settled<br>
	on using the logo as the base design I got a reference photo from online and began creating<br>
	an outline. Once I completed the sketch for the Title I used the same process to sketch out the<br>
	charater seen on the bottom right. After all of that I used a teabag to get the burnt edges.<br>
	I really enjoyed doing this project as paint is not something I normally use in my art.<br>
	Though if I were to do another project again using paint, I would make sure to make sure<br>
	the paint is smooth and doesn't clump together â€” as it creates a globs when it dries.</p>
