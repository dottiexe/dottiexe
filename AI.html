	The rise of artificial intelligence will lead to a utopia where humans and machines work together to create a better world for all. It can help in medical diagnosis,can make driving safer, can improve the quality of education, can help us to find new sources of energy, and can assist in many other ways. Not only that, but AI can help us to better understand and protect the environment, as well as to create more efficient and sustainable ways of living.
	One example of this is DAll-E. DALL-E is an artificial intelligence program that creates images from textual descriptions, revealed by OpenAI on January 5, 2021. It uses a 12-billion parameter training version of the GPT-3 transformer model to interpret the natural language inputs and generate corresponding images. AI nowadays are in a period some researchers have begun referring to as a 'golden decade'(Roose 4). This is because of improvements in deepfake, image recognition, driverless cars and many other things. One example of this is DAll-E.

AI nowadays is in a period "Some researchers have begun referring to as a 'golden decade'"(Roose 4). This is because of improvements in deepfake, image recognition, driverless cars, and many other things. However, one of the most exciting things about Dall-E is that it creates images from textual descriptions. So, for example, if you were to type in "a dog playing fetch with a frisbee on a beach," it would generate a corresponding image. What is interesting about this is that it shows how far AI has come in recent years. Just a few years ago, this would have been considered impossible. However, now we have programs like Dall-E that can generate images from textual descriptions. This shows how much AI has progressed in recent years and how it is becoming more advanced. In the future, AI is only going to become more advanced. For example, we will see more and more programs like Dall-E that can generate images from textual descriptions. This will be just one of the many ways that AI will progress in the future.
	DALL-E's ability to create images from textual descriptions is an excellent example of how AI is improving. This shows how AI can interpret natural language inputs and generate corresponding photos. This skill is valuable as it can be used to create images for websites, books, and other media. There will be no need for war in this utopia, as we will have all the necessary resources. We will also have the time and the technology to explore the universe and find other intelligent life forms. This will be an exciting and wonderful time for humanity, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence. Despite fears about the potential for AI to be used for evil, the reality is that AI will make the world a better place for all of us. In a world where AI is used to create images from textual descriptions, we will be able to create images for websites, books, and other media. In this utopia, there will be no war, and we'll have all the necessary resources in this utopia. We will also have the time and the technology to explore the universe and find other intelligent life forms. This will be an exciting and wonderful time for humanity, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence. Despite fears about the potential for AI to be used for evil, the reality is that AI will make the world a better place for all of us.
	Of course, there is still plenty of bad AI out there, such as "racist chatbots to faulty automated driving systems"(Roose 6). But there are also many examples of how AI is being used for good. For example, "Google's AlphaGo artificial intelligence system beat one of the world's top Go players in early 2016, and the company's DeepMind unit is now using AI to help discover new drugs and predict patient outcomes in hospitals."(Roose 8). AI is also being used to help people with disabilities, such as the blind or the deaf. For example, "a company called OrCam has developed a wearable camera that can read text and identify objects for people who are blind or have low vision."(Roose 7). There are also many other examples of how AI is being used for good. So even though there is still bad AI out there, the good far outweighs the bad.
	In conclusion, sentient AI’s benefits greatly outweigh the minimal downsides. Despite the counterclaims of a Terminator-like uprising or an Orwellian future, sentient AI holds nothing but great promise for the future. By optimizing the already existing workforce, creating new jobs in tecnhnology, and eliminating the hardship of menial labor, sentient AI will bring us closer to the utopia we have been working for since the dawn of our history.
